## Items
### Weapons
- In game, there is a vast range of weapons to choose from (see: Money Shop >> List of weapons),
- Sniper rifles, Special Weapons and Optical Weapons can be aimed with. If the player holds such a weapon, when their crosshair approaches the window border, their view is “extended” to the direction they’re looking in,
- Weapons are divided into types (SMG, Sniper, AR etc.),
- Some weapons have special tags:
  - AP - Can penetrate through thicker surfaces, armor etc.
  - SPC - Special weapon, cannot be bought. These weapons are  Obtainable only as loot from enemy drops, Item Chests or as quest rewards,
  - OPT - Optical weapons, much more accurate, but can be easily countered by energy shields,

### Keys
- Keys can be used to open Item Chests scattered throughout the levels. 
- They can only be obtained as loot from enemy drops and as quest rewards,

### Syringes
- Syringes are used for healing purposes. They add an X amount of HP to a user over time. The process is fast, though it still takes time,
- They have one time use. Upon using, one instance is deleted from the user’s inventory,
- They can be obtained by buying them in the Money Shop or as loot from enemy drops,

## Map Layout
- This is a typical map layout used for the majority of levels in the game. Of course, some levels may have other layouts,

## Item Chests
- On some levels, in the orange zone (see: Map Layout), secret chests can be found,
- When the player comes close enough to the chest (and doesn’t have the key responsible for opening it), it will display a text box over it, which will say it needs a key to open it,
- When the player has the key and comes close enough to the chest, the player will be able to interact with it using a keystroke to open it,
- Upon opening the chest, it will give the player a reward, such as a weapon, money or experience points,

## NPCs
- On some levels, in the green zone (see: Map Layout), special NPCs can be found,

- The player can interact with them and can receive quests from them, that can give them special items, such as Special Weapons, Chest Keys, money or experience points,
- Expected NPCs
  - Llenn - Quest reward: P-Chan SMG,
  - Fuka - Quest reward: MGL-140 GL,
  - Pitohui - Quest reward: Muramasa F9 Pito Version SWD,
